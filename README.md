# ElliotBot
Repository for development of the Discord bot 'ElliotBot'

Elliot (full name Elliot Rigby) is my cat. In experimenting with discord bots, I came up with the idea with implementing a bot that posts randomized pictures of him.
I made this repository to do just that.

The function of this bot is very simple. Utilizing an uptime-robot, he is a 24/7 functioning bot that posts a randomized picture of Elliot when the command
$meow is typed.

I don't plan on expanding much of ElliotBot's functionality other than occasionally adding more photos of him.
